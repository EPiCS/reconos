0. Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge of the development
for an FPGA and setup the appropriate tools and your board. The
following list includes all prerequisites:

  - Linux workstation with a distribution of your choice including
     * minicom
     * NFS server

  - Xilinx ISE Design Tools (Version 14.6 or 14.7 for this guide)
    including the following components
     * Xilinx Platform Studio (XPS)
     * ARM compiler collection
     * Software Development Kit (SDK)
     * Xilinx Microprocessor Debugger (XMD)

  - Evaluation board connected to your workstation
    Currently only the Zedboard Rev. C and D are supported
     * JTAG connection to program the FPGA
     * UART connection to interact with the board

This guide uses several external sources and downloads them to your
local machine. To make shure that everything works fine you can use
the follwing tested versions or can try it with the newest ones
available:

  - Linux Kernel: http://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx
    tag: xilinx-v14.7

  - U-Boot: http://github.com/Xilinx/u-boot-xlnx
    tag: xilinx-v14.7

  - Busybox: http://git.busybox.net/busybox
    tag: 1_21_1


1. Introduction

The sort demo is an example application to demonstrate ReconOS and its
concepts. It uses both hardware and software threads to sort a bunch of
data by using mboxes to synchronize the different threads and the memory
subsystem of ReconOS to access the data.
You can use ReconOS under different operating systems and on different
FPGAs but this guide only covers the Xilinx Zynq platform running the
Linux operating system.


2. Setup ReconOS

As a first step you should inform you about the general ideas behind
ReconOS and its architecture.

At first you should think about a directory structure you want to use.
As starting point you can use the following one:

  $HOME/reconos = $WD
    \- reconos     -> the ReconOS repository = $RECONOS
    \- linux-xlnx  -> the Linux kernel sources
    \- u-boot-xlnx -> the U-Boot sources
    \- busybox     -> the busybox sources
    \- nfs         -> the root filesystem

This guide assumes this structure, so be aware if you change it.


2.1 Setup the ReconOS toolchain

At first we need to checkout the ReconOS repository:

  > cd $WD
  > git clone https://github.com/EPiCS/reconos.git

To use the ReconOS toolchain you must configure it to your needs. Therefore,
open $WD/reconos/tools/environment/zynq_linux.sh and adjust it to your machine:

  xil_tools:    enter the path to your Xilinx tools
                for example /opt/Xilinx/14.7
  gnutool:      enter the path to the gnutoolchain you want to use
                for example /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/EDK/gnu/arm/lin/bin/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-
  reconos_arch: no need to change this for this guide
  reconos_os:   no need to change this for this guide
  reconos_mmu:  no need to change this for this guide

  KDIR:  enter the path to the linux kernel
         in this case: $HOME/reconos/linux-xlnx
  PATH:  enter directories you want to include to the PATH variable
         in this case the path to the mkimage utility:
         in this case: $HOME/reconos/u-boot-xlnx/tools:$PATH

After setting up you can simply source the main setup script by

 > source $WD/reconos/tools/environment/setup_reconos_toolchain.sh zynq_linux

If you do not specify a configuration the default configuration
tools/environment/default.sh is used which should be a link to the
linux_zynq.sh configuration file. To change this, perform the following steps:

 > cd $WD/reconos/tools/environment
 > ln -sf zynq_linux.sh default.sh

Now you can compile applications to run on the ARM processor included in
the Xilinx Zynq SoC, use the Xilinx tools and use the ReconOS scripts.


3. Setup Linux

3.1 Compile U-Boot

To boot and compile Linux you first have to compile U-Boot:

  1. Download the U-Boot sources and change into this direcory
     > cd $WD
     > git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/u-boot-xlnx.git
     > cd u-boot-xlnx

  2. Configure the boot mode to download the kernel image via jtag
       - Open $WD/u-boot-xlnx/include/configs/zynq_common.h
       - Adjust the jtagboot commant by replacing
          "jtagboot=echo TFTPing Linux to RAM... && " \
          "tftp 0x3000000 ${kernel_image} && " \
          "tftp 0x2A00000 ${devicetree_image} && " \
          "tftp 0x2000000 ${ramdisk_image} && " \
          "bootm 0x3000000 0x2000000 0x2A00000\0"
         by
          "jtagboot=echo Booting Linux from RAM... && " \
          "bootm 0x3000000 - 0x2A00000\0"

  3. Disable features disabled in reference designs
       - Open $WD/u-boot-xlnx/include/configs/zynq_zed.h
       - Disable unsupported features by deleting or commenting out
          #define CONFIG_ZYNQ_SDHCI0
          #define CONFIG_ZYNQ_QSPI
          #define CONFIG_ZYNQ_BOOT_FREEBSD

  4. Compile U-Boot
     > make zynq_zed

3.2 Compile Linux

  1. Download the Linux sources and change into this directory
     > cd $WD
     > git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git
     > cd linux-xlnx

  3. Configure Linux by using the default configuration
     If you whish you can adjust the configuration to your needs
     > make xilinx_zynq_defconfig

  4. Compile Linux
     > make -j8 uImage LOADADDR=0x00008000

3.3 Build the root filesystem

To run Linux we need a root filesystem to mount. In this section we
will build a minimal root filesystem by compiling busybox. If you
do not want to build the root filesystem by your own just download
it from the ReconOS homepage and extract it to $WD/nfs

  1. Download busybox
     > cd $WD
     > git clone git://git.busybox.net/busybox
     > cd busybox

  2. Configure and build busybox
     To create a minimal busybox setup we use the provided default
     configuration in the stepbystep folder.
     > cp $WD/reconos/docs/busybox_config_1_21_1.config .config
     > make -j3
     > make install

  3. Copy busybox to your root filesystem
     > mkdir $WD/nfs
     > cp -r _install/* $WD/nfs

  4. Create directories
     > mkdir dev etc etc/init.d lib mnt opt opt/reconos proc root sys tmp

  5. Create inittab
     Create $WD/nfs/etc/inittab with the following content:

     >=== $WD/nfs/etc/inittab ===>
     ::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS

     # /bin/sh
     # 
     # Start an askfirst shell on the serial ports

     ttyPS0::respawn:-/bin/sh

     # What to do when restarting the init process

     ::restart:/sbin/init

     # What to do before rebooting

     ::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r
     >=== $WD/nfs/etc/inittab ===>

  6. Create rcS
     Create $WD/nfs/etc/init.d/rcS with the following content and
     make it executable by
     > chmod +x $WD/nfs/etc/init.d/rcS

     >=== $WD/nfs/etc/init.d/rcS ===>
     #!/bin/sh

     echo "Starting rcS..."

     echo "++ Mounting filesystem"
     mount -t proc none /proc
     mount -t sysfs none /sys
     mount -t tmpfs none /tmp

     ttydev=`cat /sys/class/tty/ttyPS0/dev`
     ttymajor=${ttydev%%:*}
     ttyminor=${ttydev##*:}
     if [ -c /dev/ttyPS0 ]
     then
             rm /dev/ttyPS0
     fi

     mknod /dev/ttyPS0 c $ttymajor $ttyminor

     echo "rcS Complete"
     >=== $WD/nfs/etc/init.d/rcS ===>


3.3 Setup NFS

For the development it has proved advantegeous to mount the root filesystem
via NFS.
WARNING: If you develop with other people on the same network make
         shure that you do not use the same ip.

  1. Configure NFS
     Add the following line to your NFS config under /etc/exports
     $HOME/reconos/nfs 192.168.42.2(rw,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)

  2. Create virutal network interface to communicate with your board
     > sudo ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.42.1 up
     You need to restart the NFS server after this


4. Compile ReconOS kernel module and setup ReconOS files

ReconOS combines all drivers needed in a single kernel module which needs
to be compiled and copied together with a initialization script to the
root filesystem.

  1. Compile ReconOS module
     > cd $RECONOS/linux/driver
     > make

  2. Copy ReconOS module and initialization script
     > mkdir -p $WD/nfs/opt/reconos
     > cp $RECONOS/linux/driver/mreconos.ko $WD/nfs/opt/reconos
     > cp $RECONOS/linux/scripts/reconos_init.sh $WD/nfs/opt/reconos
     > chmod +x $WD/nfs/opt/reconos/reconos_init.sh

You can then simply initialize the entire ReconOS system by executing
reconos_init.sh on the ARM processor.


5. Compile ReconOS library

To compile your applications ReconOS provides all functions in a C library
which must be created.

  1. Compile ReconOS library
     > cd $RECONOS/linux/lib
     > make


6. Compiling the sort demo

  1. Adjust the setup config to your working environment
       - Open $RECONOS/demos/sort_demo/hw/setup_zynq
       - Replace
           base_design=zedboard_c_minimal_14.6
         by changing the board revision and tool version

  2. Create the hardware design by using the setup script
     > cd $RECONOS/demos/sort_demo/hw
     > reconos_setup.sh setup_zynq

  3. Build project
     > cd edk_zynq_linux
     > xps -nw system
     xps> run hwclean
     xps> run bits
     xps> exit

  4. Adjust the device tree to your environment
       - Open $RECONOS/demos/sort_demo/hw/edk_zynq_linux/device_tree.dts
       - Change
           bootargs = "console=ttyPS0,115200 root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=192.168.42.1:/nfs/zynqn,tcp ip=192.168.42.2:::255.255.255.0:reconos:eth0:off earlyprintk";
         by replacing /nfs/zynqn by /home/<your username>/reconos/nfs (the path to your nfs share) and eventually the ip addresses

  5. Compile the device tree for this design
     > $WD/linux-xlnx/scripts/dtc/dts -I dts -O dtb -o device_tree.dtb device_tree.dts

  6. Compile application and copy it to NFS share
     > cd $RECONOS/demos/sort_demo/linux
     > make
     > cp sort_demo $WD/nfs/opt/reconos


7. Running the sort demo

  1. Setting up the board
     At first you have to setup your Zynq board. Connect JTAG and
     UART to your PC and connect both to the same network.
     To select the right bootmode (jtagboot) you must set jumpers
     MI02 to MI06 to GND.

  2. Open Minicom
     You need to open minicom to interact with the Zynq
     > minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

  3. Boot Linux
     To boot Linux on Zynq you can use the user defined script zynq_boot_jtag.sh
     > zynq_boot_jtag.sh $WD/linux-xlnx/arch/arm/boot/uImage
                         $RECONOS/demos/sort_demo/hw/edk_zynq_linux/device_tree.dtb
                         $RECONOS/demos/sort_demo/hw/edk_zynq_linux/ps7_init.tcl
                         $WD/u-boot-xlnx/u-boot
     This scripts caches the last used files and uses these if you call
     zynq_boot_jtag.sh without parameters. So you do not have to specify
     all arguments again the next time you use it.

  4. Program FPGA
     > cd $RECONOS/demos/sort_demo/hw/edk_zynq_linux
     > reconos_download_bitstream.sh implementation/system.bit

  5. Initialize ReconOS
     zynq> cd /opt/reconos
     zynq> ./reconos_init.sh

  6. Execute sort demo
     zynq> cd /opt/reconos
     zynq> ./sort_demo
     This shows how to use the sort_demo, e.g. you can run it with 4 HWTs and 2 SWTs
     on 16 blocks of data by calling
     zynq> ./sort_demo 4 2 16
